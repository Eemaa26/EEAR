Energy Efficiency Analytics using R
===================

Overview
--------
This is the first early release of a prototype package aimed at analyzing smart meter interval energy data with the intent of helping energy advisors and analysts identify potential touch points for EE savings. 

Thanks go to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) for allowing me the flexibility and time to develop this package. This is in no way endorsed or used by SMUD.
